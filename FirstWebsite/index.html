    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Encountering the Unconscious</h1>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">“Interlude: Shadow” Explained</h2>
    <h3>This is heading 3</h3>

    <p style="text-align:left;">Before getting into the music video and lyrics, it’s helpful to have an understanding of
        some of Jung’s ideas surrounding the unconscious, the shadow, and the self.
        Jung believed that beyond our consciousness, a deep unconscious realm exists—a realm in which repressed
        attributes reside.
        The shadow, he theorized, contains negative traits we’ve put aside, as well as any traits we learned were not
        acceptable (even if those traits weren’t inherently bad).
        Additionally, Jung thought that our consciousness was not the whole of the “self,” and that in order to achieve
        wholeness and reach one’s true self, one must go through the individuation process.
        This process requires us to encounter and integrate our unconscious elements into our conscious selves.
        After a person acknowledges their persona (a social mask we wear to fit in with society), they can move on to
        their first encounter with the unconscious: the shadow.

    <p style="text-align:right;">Murray Stein, in Jung’s Map of the Soul, writes, “The problem of integrating the shadow
        is a moral and psychological problem of the most thorny sort.
        If a person completely shuns the shadow, life is proper but it is terribly incomplete.
        By opening up to shadow experience, however, a person becomes tainted with immorality but attains a greater
        degree of wholeness.”
        Jung believed that shadow integration was difficult and that if someone did not go through this process, the
        result could be chaos.
        Stein notes that most people “only reveal shadowy elements by accident, in dreams, or when pushed to extremes.”
        The shadow exists in everyone, and it influences us from the unconscious. And if we don’t deal with it, we can’t
        become truly whole.
        It’s this first step into the unconscious that is expressed through “Interlude: Shadow.”
